# SSH Known Hosts for M-Tunnel
# Add your SSH server host keys here using:
# ssh-keyscan -H your-ssh-server.com >> /etc/m-tunnel/known_hosts
#
# Example entries (replace with your actual host keys):
# |1|hash1234...= ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAAB...
# |1|hash5678...= ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 AAAAE2VjZHNhLXNoYTItb...
#
# For initial setup, you can disable host checking temporarily by editing
# the SSH command in src/main.rs, but this is NOT RECOMMENDED for production!
