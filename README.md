# M-Tunnel ‚Äî Secure Business Network Bridge

M-Tunnel is a high-performance SSH tunnel manager designed specifically for **business environments** where headquarters need reliable, secure access to services at remote branches ‚Äî shops, restaurants, warehouses, and distributed locations.

Built in **Rust** for maximum reliability and minimal resource usage, M-Tunnel ensures your business-critical connections stay up 24/7 with blazing-fast performance that won't strain your branch infrastructure.

‚≠ê **If this helps your business operations, a star or fork shows your support!**

## Why M-Tunnel for Business?

**The Problem**: Your headquarters needs secure access to POS systems, inventory databases, security cameras, and other services running at dozens or hundreds of remote locations. Traditional VPN solutions are complex, resource-heavy, and unreliable.

**The Solution**: M-Tunnel creates lightweight, encrypted SSH tunnels that connect your HQ directly to branch services with enterprise-grade reliability.

## Why Rust?

- **Blazing Fast**: Near-zero latency overhead for real-time business operations
- **Rock Solid Reliability**: Memory safety prevents crashes that could disconnect critical business systems
- **Resource Efficient**: Minimal CPU and RAM usage ‚Äî perfect for branch locations with limited hardware
- **Always On**: Built-in retry logic and connection monitoring ensure 99.9%+ uptime
- **Secure by Default**: No buffer overflows, no memory leaks, no security vulnerabilities

## Key Features

- **Native SSH2 Implementation**: No external dependencies ‚Äî just one binary to deploy
- **Multi-Branch Support**: Manage tunnels to hundreds of locations from a single configuration
- **Business-Grade Reliability**: Automatic reconnection, connection throttling, and health monitoring
- **Zero-Touch Operation**: Deploy once, runs forever with comprehensive logging
- **Secure Configuration**: TOML-based setup with SSH key validation and secure defaults

## Business Use Cases

### Retail Chain Management

```toml
# Connect HQ to store POS systems and inventory databases
[[tunnels]]
name = "store-001-pos"
direction = "forward"
local_port = 5432
remote_host = "store-pos.local"
remote_port = 5432

[[tunnels]]
name = "store-001-cameras"
direction = "forward"
local_port = 8080
remote_host = "security-cam.local"
remote_port = 80
```

### Restaurant Chain Operations

```toml
# Access kitchen displays, payment systems, and analytics
[[tunnels]]
name = "restaurant-kitchen"
direction = "forward"
local_port = 3306
remote_host = "kitchen-system.local"
remote_port = 3306

[[tunnels]]
name = "restaurant-analytics"
direction = "receive"
local_port = 9090
remote_host = "analytics.hq"
remote_port = 443
```

## Quick Start

Deploy M-Tunnel at your headquarters and branch locations:

```bash
# At headquarters - clone and build
git clone https://github.com/mufkuw/m-tunnel-rust.git
cd m-tunnel-rust
cargo build --release

# Test configuration (safe dry-run)
./target/release/m-tunnel --ssh2 --config configs/branch-connection.toml --dry-run

# Deploy to production
sudo cp target/release/m-tunnel /usr/local/bin/
```

## Configuration for Business

Create a configuration file for each branch connection:

```toml
[ssh]
host = "branch-001.company.com"  # Your branch server
user = "tunnel-user"
port = 22
key_path = "/etc/m-tunnel/branch-001.key"
timeout = 30
keepalive_interval = 60

[limits]
max_attempts = 5          # Retry failed connections
retry_window_secs = 300   # Connection throttling
max_backoff_secs = 120    # Maximum wait between retries

# Forward HQ access to branch services
[[tunnels]]
name = "branch-database"
direction = "forward"
local_host = "127.0.0.1"
local_port = 5432        # HQ connects to localhost:5432
remote_host = "db.branch.local"
remote_port = 5432       # Connects to branch database

[[tunnels]]
name = "branch-web-admin"
direction = "forward"
local_host = "127.0.0.1"
local_port = 8080        # HQ admin panel at localhost:8080
remote_host = "admin.branch.local"
remote_port = 80

# Allow branch to push data to HQ
[[tunnels]]
name = "hq-reporting"
direction = "receive"
local_host = "127.0.0.1"
local_port = 9443
remote_host = "reports.hq.company.com"
remote_port = 443
enabled = true
```

## Deployment & Testing

### Validation Scripts

M-Tunnel includes comprehensive testing to ensure business-grade reliability:

```bash

# Install as system service
sudo cp target/release/m-tunnel /usr/local/bin/
sudo cp m-tunnel.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl enable m-tunnel
sudo systemctl start m-tunnel
```

### Monitoring & Health Checks

```bash
# Check tunnel status
sudo systemctl status m-tunnel

# View connection logs
sudo journalctl -u m-tunnel -f

# Verify tunnels are working
netstat -tlnp | grep m-tunnel
```
