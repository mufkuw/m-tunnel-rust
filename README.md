## **NO PORTS AT BRANCHES + ONLY 1 PORT AT HQ**

M-Tunnel is a high-performance network bridge designed specifically for **business environments** where headquarters need reliable, secure access to services at remote branches ‚Äî shops, restaurants, warehouses, and distributed locations.

**üîí Firewall-friendly architecture:**

- **Branches**: Zero inbound ports required ‚Äî uses outbound connections only
- **Headquarters**: Only 1 port needed for the M-Tunnel-Gate server
- **Result**: No complex firewall rules, no security vulnerabilities from open ports at remote locations

Built in **Rust** for maximum reliability and minimal resource usage, M-Tunnel ensures your business-critical connections stay up 24/7 with blazing-fast performance that won't strain your branch infrastructure.

‚≠ê **If this helps your business operations, a star or fork shows your support!**

## Why M-Tunnel for Business?

**The Problem**: Many businesses rely on VPNs to connect HQ and branches, but VPNs are often costly (monthly fees), resource-heavy, consume large amounts of data, and require complex firewall and network configuration at every location. That makes them impractical for stores, kiosks, and embedded devices.

**The Solution**: M-Tunnel (client) and M-Tunnel-Gate (HQ) provide a tiny, secure, and blazing-fast infrastructure that runs comfortably on embedded or low-cost devices. Deploy M-Tunnel at branches and a single M-Tunnel-Gate at HQ ‚Äî no inbound ports at branches and only one port at HQ ‚Äî drastically reducing cost, configuration overhead, and operational complexity. M-Tunnel is free to use under AGPLv3 (with the usual share-alike obligations).

## Why Rust?

- **Blazing Fast**: Near-zero latency overhead for real-time business operations
- **Rock Solid Reliability**: Memory safety prevents crashes that could disconnect critical business systems
- **Resource Efficient**: Minimal CPU and RAM usage ‚Äî perfect for branch locations with limited hardware
- **Always On**: Built-in retry logic and connection monitoring ensure 99.9%+ uptime
- **Secure by Default**: No buffer overflows, no memory leaks, no security vulnerabilities

## Key Features

- **üîí MINIMAL FIREWALL SETUP**: Zero ports at branches + only 1 port at HQ M-Tunnel-Gate
- **Single Binary**: No external dependencies ‚Äî just one binary to deploy at each location
- **Multi-Branch Support**: Manage connections to hundreds of locations from a single configuration
- **Business-Grade Reliability**: Automatic reconnection, connection throttling, and health monitoring
- **Zero-Touch Operation**: Deploy once, runs forever with comprehensive logging
- **Secure Configuration**: TOML-based setup with key validation and secure defaults

## Business Use Cases

### Retail Chain Management

```toml
# Connect HQ to store POS systems and inventory databases
[[tunnels]]
name = "store-001-pos"
direction = "forward"
local_port = 5432
remote_host = "store-pos.local"
remote_port = 5432

[[tunnels]]
name = "store-001-cameras"
direction = "forward"
local_port = 8080
remote_host = "security-cam.local"
remote_port = 80
```

### Restaurant Chain Operations

```toml
# Access kitchen displays, payment systems, and analytics
[[tunnels]]
name = "restaurant-kitchen"
direction = "forward"
local_port = 3306
remote_host = "kitchen-system.local"
remote_port = 3306

[[tunnels]]
name = "restaurant-analytics"
direction = "receive"
local_port = 9090
remote_host = "analytics.hq"
remote_port = 443
```

## Quick Start

**Simple Architecture**:

- **HQ**: Install M-Tunnel-Gate server (requires only 1 port open)
- **Branches**: Install M-Tunnel client (no inbound ports required)
- **Connection**: Branches connect outbound to HQ, creating secure bridge

Deploy M-Tunnel at your headquarters and branch locations:

```bash
# At headquarters - clone and build
git clone https://github.com/mufkuw/m-tunnel-rust.git
cd m-tunnel-rust
cargo build --release

# Test configuration (safe dry-run)
./target/release/m-tunnel --config configs/branch-connection.toml --dry-run

# Deploy to production
sudo cp target/release/m-tunnel /usr/local/bin/
```

## Configuration for Business

Create a configuration file for each branch connection:

```toml
[connection]
host = "hq-gate.company.com"  # Your HQ M-Tunnel-Gate server
user = "tunnel-user"
port = 22
key_path = "/etc/m-tunnel/branch-001.key"
timeout = 30
keepalive_interval = 60

[limits]
max_attempts = 5          # Retry failed connections
retry_window_secs = 300   # Connection throttling
max_backoff_secs = 120    # Maximum wait between retries

# Forward HQ access to branch services
[[tunnels]]
name = "branch-database"
direction = "forward"
local_host = "127.0.0.1"
local_port = 5432        # HQ connects to localhost:5432
remote_host = "db.branch.local"
remote_port = 5432       # Connects to branch database

[[tunnels]]
name = "branch-web-admin"
direction = "forward"
local_host = "127.0.0.1"
local_port = 8080        # HQ admin panel at localhost:8080
remote_host = "admin.branch.local"
remote_port = 80

# Allow branch to push data to HQ
[[tunnels]]
name = "hq-reporting"
direction = "receive"
local_host = "127.0.0.1"
local_port = 9443
remote_host = "reports.hq.company.com"
remote_port = 443
enabled = true
```

## Deployment & Testing

### Validation Scripts

M-Tunnel includes comprehensive testing to ensure business-grade reliability:

```bash
