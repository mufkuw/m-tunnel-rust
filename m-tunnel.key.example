# Example SSH private key template
# 
# This is a TEMPLATE file showing the expected format.
# DO NOT put your real private key here!
# 
# To use:
# 1. Generate your SSH key: ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f m-tunnel.key
# 2. Copy the private key content to the actual m-tunnel.key file
# 3. Set proper permissions: chmod 600 m-tunnel.key
# 4. Add the public key to your remote server's authorized_keys
#
# Format should be:
# -----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
# [base64 encoded key data]
# -----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----

# This file is safe to commit as it contains no real key data
