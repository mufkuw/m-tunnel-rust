## Configuration

M-Tunnel supports both legacy and modern configuration formats:

### Modern TOML Configuration (Recommended)

```toml
[ssh]
host = "example.com"
user = "username"
port = 22
key_path = "~/.ssh/id_rsa"
timeout = 30
keepalive_interval = 60

[limits]
max_attempts = 3
retry_window_secs = 300
max_backoff_secs = 60

[[tunnels]]
name = "web-tunnel"
direction = "receive"
local_host = "127.0.0.1"
local_port = 8080
remote_host = "internal.web"
remote_port = 80
enabled = true

[[tunnels]]
name = "db-tunnel"
direction = "forward"
local_host = "127.0.0.1"
local_port = 5432
remote_host = "database.internal"
remote_port = 5432
enabled = true
```

## Architecture

The SSH2 implementation features a modern, production-ready architecture:

```rust
pub struct TunnelManager {
    pub config: Config,
    pub metrics: Arc<MetricsCollector>,
    pub connection_limiter: Arc<Mutex<ConnectionLimiter>>,
    pub shutdown: Arc<Mutex<bool>>,
}

impl TunnelManager {
    pub async fn start(&self) -> Result<()> { /* async tunnel management */ }
    pub async fn shutdown(&self) -> Result<()> { /* graceful shutdown */ }
}
```
